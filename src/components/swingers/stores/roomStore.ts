 * *current* state of `openViduEntitiesStore`. However, the `listen` already handles this reactivity.
 *
 * It is advisable to remove calls to this function from components and rely on the `listen` hook.
 * For now, making it effectively a passthrough to avoid breaking existing code that might call it.
 *
 * @param rooms An array of IRoom objects.
