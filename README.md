## ‚ú® Features

- ü§ñ **AI-Powered Code Generation & Modification**: Interact with a powerful AI to generate new files, modify existing ones, or delete files based on natural language instructions.
- üí° **Interactive Proposed Changes**: View AI's proposed changes with detailed file paths, action types (ADD, MODIFY, DELETE), and AI-generated reasons. Selectively apply or discard individual changes, and even edit the proposed content before application.
- üìä **Git Diff Visualization**: Inspect detailed git diffs for proposed modifications and deletions directly within the editor before applying changes, ensuring transparency and control.
- üîí **Secure Authentication**: Seamlessly log in using Google or GitHub OAuth2 for secure access to the editor, with user session management handled by the backend.
- üìÇ **Project Context & Scanning**: Specify a project root path and relevant scan paths for the AI to analyze, providing crucial context for intelligent code suggestions and understanding project structure.
- üöÄ **File Tree Navigation**: Browse your project's file structure with an interactive file tree, allowing for easy exploration and selection of files, and viewing their content.
- üåç **Modern UI/UX**: Built with React, Material-UI, and Tailwind CSS for a responsive, accessible, and intuitive user experience.
- ‚ö° **Vite Development**: Fast development and build times powered by Vite, providing a modern and efficient development workflow.

## üìã Requirements

- Node.js >= 18
- AI Editor Backend (running and accessible via `VITE_API_URL`)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

```bash
# Navigate to the project root (ai-editor-front)
cd ai-editor-front

# Install dependencies
pnpm install # or npm install / yarn install
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

pnpm run dev

# Build for production
pnpm run build

# Start production build (requires a build first)
pnpm run preview
```

## üìñ API Reference

This frontend interacts with the `ai-editor` backend. Please refer to the backend documentation for detailed API endpoints for authentication, AI code generation, and file operations.

---

## üîë Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of `ai-editor-front`. **Do not commit `.env.local` to version control.**

```ini
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3000          # The URL of your AI Editor backend API
VITE_FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3001     # The URL where your frontend is hosted (e.g., for OAuth redirects)
VITE_BASE_DIR=/path/to/your/project/root    # **Optional**: Default project root to pre-fill in the editor. Can be overridden in the UI.
# The following are used by the backend for constructing OAuth redirect URLs, but are included here for completeness.
# The actual values for these environment variables should be configured in your backend service.
GITHUB_CALLBACK_URL=/auth/github/callback   # Relative path for GitHub OAuth callback (handled by backend)
GOOGLE_CALLBACK_URL=/auth/google/callback   # Relative path for Google OAuth callback (handled by backend)
```

---

## üß™ Testing

```bash
# Run all tests (currently placeholder, update as testing framework is integrated)
npm test

# With coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

## üì¶ Deployment

- **Vercel**
  [![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/import/project?template=https://github.com/evillan0315/ai-editor-front)

---

## üìä Roadmap

- [ ] **Real-time File Content Editing**: Enable editing the content of _any_ selected file from the file tree in a dedicated editor panel, beyond just AI-proposed changes, with options to save changes.
- [ ] **WebSocket Integration**: Implement real-time updates from the backend, such as file system changes, AI generation progress, and new notifications.
- [ ] **Enhanced Error Handling & Feedback**: Improve user-facing error messages, loading indicators, and success notifications across the application.
- [ ] **Dedicated Settings Page**: Develop a page for user preferences, AI model selection, API key configurations, and other configurable options.
- [ ] **Local Authentication**: Implement standard email/password login and registration forms for users who prefer not to use OAuth providers.
- [ ] **UI/UX Refinements**: Continuous improvements to the user interface for a smoother and more intuitive experience.
