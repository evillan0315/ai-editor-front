# Using Dynamic Forms

This guide explains how to interact with dynamic forms within the Project Board application. Dynamic forms are intelligent forms that adapt their appearance and fields based on a predefined template (called a "schema"). This means that forms for different types of data (e.g., projects, tasks, user profiles) can look and behave differently, even though they are generated by the same underlying system.

## What is a Dynamic Form?

Imagine a questionnaire where the questions change based on your previous answers. Dynamic forms work similarly: they are generated on-the-fly from a blueprint (the schema). This allows the application to create highly specific and tailored input forms without needing a developer to manually code each one.

## Interacting with Fields

You will encounter various types of input fields, each designed for a specific kind of information:

### 1. Text Fields

-   **Purpose**: For entering short pieces of text (names, titles, codes) or longer descriptions.
-   **Interaction**: Simply type your information into the field.
-   **Multiline Text Areas**: Some text fields might be larger, allowing you to enter multiple lines of text, perfect for detailed descriptions or notes.

### 2. Number Fields

-   **Purpose**: For entering numerical values (quantities, ages, priorities).
-   **Interaction**: Type numbers. Some fields might automatically restrict input to whole numbers (integers) or allow decimals.
-   **Limits**: You might see a hint indicating a minimum or maximum allowed value.

### 3. Checkboxes

-   **Purpose**: For selecting a "yes" or "no" (true/false) option.
-   **Interaction**: Click the box to toggle it on (checked) or off (unchecked).

### 4. Dropdowns (Select Fields)

-   **Purpose**: For choosing one option from a predefined list.
-   **Interaction**: Click on the field to open a list of choices, then click on your desired option.

### 5. Date Pickers

-   **Purpose**: For selecting a specific date.
-   **Interaction**: Click on the date field to open a calendar interface, then select your desired date.

## Handling Lists (Arrays of Items)

Many forms will require you to add multiple similar items, such as team members, tasks, or specifications. These are displayed as lists.

-   **Adding Items**: Look for an "Add [Item Name] Item" button. Clicking this will add a new blank entry to the list, often with its own set of fields to fill out.
-   **Removing Items**: Each item in a list will typically have a small "X" or trashcan icon next to it. Click this icon to remove that specific item from the list.
-   **Nested Forms**: Sometimes, an item in a list might itself be a complex structure, meaning it will contain its own set of fields, forming a "form within a form". Just fill these out as you would any other form.

## Understanding UI Layout

Dynamic forms often use an intelligent layout system to arrange fields on the page. You might see fields organized into columns or rows to make the form easier to read and fill out. This layout is determined by the form's template and will adjust automatically.

## Saving Your Data

Once you have filled out the form, there will usually be a "Save" or "Submit" button at the bottom of the page. Clicking this will process your input and update the relevant information in the application.

If you have any questions about a specific form or field, please refer to the context where that form is used or consult a developer for details on its underlying schema.
